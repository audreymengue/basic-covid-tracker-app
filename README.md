# Basic covid-19 app 

This project is my contribution to the fight against the pandemic.

## Description
This application displays daily data about covid-19 cases from all over the world. As a Java developer, I am 
building the application using Springboot framework. With Spring, I can have both frontend and backend at the same place.
The difficult part of this project was to get access to the right data and get our application to work with
that data even though it constantly changes.

## Install and run project

Close the repo open it in intellij or any other IDE and run it from there.

## Technologies used

1. Springboot
2. Java
3. daily updated data from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv
4. Testing: JUnit5 and Mockito

## Resources

 I got the inspiration from Java Brains Tutorial: Building a coronavirus app tracker with Spring oot and Java.
